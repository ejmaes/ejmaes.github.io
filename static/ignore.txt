Great! Now that you have a simple, working site, here's how to deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your site

2. Build your site locally:
```bash
hugo --minify
```
This will create a `public` directory with your built site.

3. Initialize git in your project if you haven't already:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

4. Connect to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. For GitHub Pages deployment, you have two options:

**Option 1: Deploy from the /docs folder**
- Update your config.toml to build to the docs folder:
  ```toml
  baseURL = "https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/"
  publishDir = "docs"
  ```
- Rebuild your site: `hugo --minify`
- Commit and push the docs folder
- In GitHub repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the "main branch /docs folder" as the source

**Option 2: Use GitHub Actions (recommended)**
- Create a file `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`
- Add this content:
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy Hugo site

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Setup Hugo
          uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
          with:
            hugo-version: 'latest'
        - name: Build
          run: hugo --minify
        - name: Deploy
          uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./public
  ```
- Push this file to GitHub
- GitHub will build and deploy your site automatically

To further customize your site:
- Add custom CSS in the `<style>` section or link to a separate CSS file
- Add more sections to the page as needed
- Add images, project details, etc.
- Use JavaScript for interactive elements if desired

Let me know if you need help with any specific part of the customization or deployment process!
